# **APIMatic Docs as Code Documentation Review & Recommendations**  

I reviewed APIMatic’s **Docs as Code** documentation in depth, looking at its structure, clarity, and usability. The documentation does a great job of outlining workflows and providing technical details, but there are areas where small adjustments could make the experience even smoother for users. Here’s what stands out and where improvements could be made.

---

## **What Works Well**  

### **1. Clear Workflow Breakdown**  
The documentation is structured in a way that guides users step by step. Each major process—whether it’s **preparing the build input, generating an API portal (Sync or Async API), automating with GitHub Actions, or migrating from an existing portal**—is logically explained.  

For example, in **"Automate API Portal Generation using the Async API,"** the breakdown is precise:  
- Push changes to GitHub  
- Send a request to the Async API  
- Poll the status endpoint  
- Download and deploy the portal  

This logical flow makes it easy for users to integrate Docs as Code into their workflows.  

### **2. Strong Real-World Examples**  
Certain sections provide detailed, copy-paste-ready examples, which is extremely useful. The **GitHub Actions workflows** in the automation guides (**Sync and Async APIs**) are well thought out, with clear steps for:  
- Zipping the repository contents  
- Calling APIMatic’s API  
- Deploying the portal to Netlify  

Similarly, **"Generate an API Portal using the Async API"** includes a response example that shows users what to expect:  
```json
{
  "id": "0194caa0-d38a-72e9-bcc8-df71acb5fd97",
  "links": {
    "status": "https://api.apimatic.io/portal/v2/0194caa0-d38a-72e9-bcc8-df71acb5fd97/status",
    "download": "https://api.apimatic.io/portal/v2/0194caa0-d38a-72e9-bcc8-df71acb5fd97/download"
  }
}
```
Including real API responses like this makes integration much smoother.

### **3. Error Handling in Automation Workflows**  
The **"Automate API Portal Generation using the Async API"** page does a great job of including error handling in the GitHub Actions YAML file. The workflow is structured to:  
- Detect failed portal generation  
- Upload error artifacts for debugging  
- Properly handle redirections (`302` status codes)  

Having this built-in error detection prevents issues from going unnoticed and makes debugging easier.

## **Areas for Improvement & Recommendations**  

### **1. Missing API Request Examples in Key Sections**  
Some pages describe API endpoints but don’t provide the corresponding request examples. This forces users to look elsewhere or guess at the request format.  

#### **Example: "Generate a Portal using the Sync API"**  
The page mentions invoking the API but doesn’t show how to do it.  

**Suggested Fix:** Add a clear API request example:  
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.apimatic.io/v1/generate-portal" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "buildInput": {
        "specs": ["openapi.json"],
        "languageConfig": {
            "http": {}
        }
    }
}' --output portal.zip
```  
This makes implementation straightforward and reduces the chances of errors.

### **2. Authentication Key Setup Needs More Clarity**  
Several sections, including **"Prepare the Build Input,"** mention that an **authentication key is required** but don’t explain how to obtain it. Users unfamiliar with APIMatic may not know where to find it.  

**Suggested Fix:**  
- Add a short section explaining how to generate the API key in the APIMatic dashboard.  
- Provide a direct link to an authentication guide.  

---

### **3. More Details on Hosting API Portals**  
Pages like **"Generate a Portal using the Sync API"** mention hosting the generated portal but don’t provide instructions. Simply stating that users should "extract and host it on any web server" is too vague.  

**Suggested Fix:**  
Expand the hosting section with specific deployment options, such as:  
- **Previewing locally**  
  ```bash
  npx http-server ./portal
  ```
- **Deploying to GitHub Pages**  
  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
    with:
      publish_dir: ./static-portal
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  ```

This would save time and effort for users unfamiliar with deployment options.  

---

### **4. Define Polling Intervals for Async API**  
The **"Generate a Portal using the Async API"** page instructs users to **poll the status endpoint periodically** but doesn’t suggest a recommended polling interval.  

**Suggested Fix:**  
Add a best practice recommendation:  
> "We recommend polling the status endpoint every **5-10 seconds** to balance efficiency and server load."  

This small addition helps users optimize their requests.  

---

### **5. No Troubleshooting Section**  
If an API request fails, users have to diagnose issues themselves since there is **no dedicated troubleshooting guide.**  

**Suggested Fix:**  
Add a **Troubleshooting** section with common errors and solutions, such as:  
- **401 Unauthorized:** Ensure that the API key is correctly added to GitHub Secrets.  
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** The API specification is too large—use the **Async API** instead.  
- **Deployment Failed:** Verify that the Netlify authentication token is correct.  

This would significantly cut down on user frustration.  

---

### **6. The Migration Guide Needs More Details on Build Input**  
The **"Migrating from Existing Portal to the Docs as Code Workflow"** page explains how to generate a **Build Input** but doesn’t detail **what’s inside the file.** Users might not fully understand what’s being transferred.  

**Suggested Fix:**  
Include a **sample structure of the build input file**, such as:  
```json
{
  "apiSpecs": ["openapi.json"],
  "customContent": {
    "guides": ["docs/guide1.md", "docs/guide2.md"],
    "tableOfContents": "docs/toc.yml"
  },
  "staticAssets": ["images/logo.png"]
}
```  
This provides users with better visibility into what’s being migrated.

APIMatic’s Docs as Code documentation is well-organized and technically detailed, making it easy to follow. However, small refinements could **greatly improve the user experience.**  

### **Key Improvements That Would Have a Big Impact:**  
- Add missing API request examples (especially for Sync API requests)
- Clarify how to obtain API authentication keys  
- Expand hosting instructions with step-by-step deployment options  
- Specify recommended polling intervals for the Async API  
- Include a dedicated troubleshooting section for common API and deployment issues  
- Provide details on what’s included in a Build Input file during migration  

These adjustments would make the documentation more **comprehensive, user-friendly, and accessible**, especially for developers integrating Docs as Code into their workflows.
